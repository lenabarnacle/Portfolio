Hello!

I am a dedicated data analyst with 4+ years of relevant experience and a penchant for statistics. Before turning to analytics, I worked as an appraiser (real estate + business investments) for 6 years but decided to pursue a different career path.

Now I work for a fast-growing data-driven startup, which means I get to work in a fast-paced environment and my tasks are very diverse: I create various business purposes data models, reports and dashboards, build and maintain pipelines for collecting data from various sources and participate in the development of a unique web services platform designed to evaluate revenue potential of product ideas, provide market research analysis and identify market trends.

Here are some code examples.
